Of the hundreds of Spectrum games I owned, this one stands out a little and I think this is due to the quirky nature of the gameplay and the odd name of the game.

Released by **Silversoft Ltd** in 1984.

The title's quite right, they do. The ship's sprung a leak and the sailor-robot needs to stop it - at the same time keeping the vessel on course, pumping out the water and oiling the engine. Remember to keep the hatches closed, or you'll perish sooner rather than later. 

You control a sea-droid that is seemingly alone aboard his vessel and has to ensure that the ship reaches it desination without sinking into the depths.

> <cite>There are some games you come across that, based on a simple idea, are nevertheless completely compelling â€” this is one. Worse Things Happen at Sea is a nightmare of activity. At first it all seems fruitless, as though you can never keep the ship afloat, but as you get better it seems easier. Unfortunately, the game has been programmed to grow with you! Oiling engines and steering wheels are added to the already Herculean tasks of pumping and patching. The graphics are really very good, crisp drawing and good colouring. A massive choice of keys is offered and the keyboard is very responsive too. All in all an excellent, original game. Great instructions on screen too.</cite>
